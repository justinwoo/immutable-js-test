#Immutable-JS test

Uses Karma to run a basic Jasmine test for definition

##Installation

`npm install` should handle everything

##Running

`npm test` has been set up to build the source and run the test

`karma start --auto-watch` to have it standing to test various browsers

I use the WinXP/IE8 image available from modern.ie to do IE8 testing

##Misc

Use `npm link` to work off of a local copy of immutable-js.
